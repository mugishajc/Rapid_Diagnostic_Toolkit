Contributing to the Rapid Diagnostic Toolkit
==========================

The Rapid Diagnostics Toolkit is primarily developed by `Dimagi`_, but is 
a community asset with shared governance. 

We welcome submissions which improve the applicability of the toolkit to 
classifiers, to consumers, or which enhance the core functionalities.

Code Contributions
------------------
We use github's `issue tracker`_ for tracking issues and improvements to
the toolkit. 

Please keep in mind that these tools need to interface with a broad set
of tools with a difficult testing path, and some functionality may need
to remain consistent even when "better" options may be available. As
such, contributions will be easier to review and manage if they are 
made modularly available without overlapping existing tools.

Please keep in mind that we hold the standard of quality in contributions
to a very high level regardless of source. Contributions which have very
limited scope, come with rigorous tests, and have their purpose outlined
in a Github issue are much more likely to be reviewed for inclusion.
